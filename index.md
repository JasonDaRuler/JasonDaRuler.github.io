### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    I found lab 3, part 2 enjoyable because it was the start of my programming journey. I learned how to declare data types and understand why the void data type is utilized in a source code. It was also interesting to see that there are other ways to print an output rather than using std::cout. A certain thing I remember struggling with was understanding where to position the codes to pass the formatting test.

* Lab 4

    I found lab 4, part 1 interesting because it was a program that was able to take one input and convert it into different measurements. I liked how the program was made for convenience and to help everyday life be more efficient. I believe this was the first program where we utilized double data type and had the program take the input and output into multiple different measurements. This was also one of the easiest labs that I found compared to the others since it was just utilizing math formulas.

* Lab 6

    I found lab 6, part 2 exciting because Iâ€™ve always been interested in blackjack. To be able to code the game for my enjoyment, it was nice to see what goes on behind the scenes. This lab utilizes many bool data types; if the current round is over 21, it would be a bust. I also learned how to convert strings to integers which gave me a broader understanding of programming.
